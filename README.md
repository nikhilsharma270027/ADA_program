# ADA_program
FINAL ADA LAB LIST

1. Write a program to find sum of an array and perform operation count.

2. Write a program to find sum of n natural numbers and determine the time required to find the sum. Repeat the experiment for different values of n, then find the sum and plot a graph of the time taken versus n.

3. Write a program to find GCD of two numbers using recursion and calculate the time taken.

4. Write a program to sort a given set of elements using the Quick Sort method and determine the time required to sort the elements. Repeat the experiment for different values of n, the number of elements in the list to be sorted and plot a graph of the time taken versus n.

5. Write a program to sort a given set of elements using the Merge sort method and determine the time required to sort the elements Repeat the experiment for different values of n, the number of elements in the list to be sorted and plot a graph of the time taken versus n.

6. Write a program to search for an element using binary earch and calculate the time taken. Repeat the experiment for different values of n and search element and plot a graph of the time taken versus n.

7. Write a program to search the pattern in a given text using Brute force method [PATTERN MATCHING]

8. Write a program to find the minimum cost spanning tree for the graph using Prim's algorithm

9. Write a program to implement all pair shortest path using Floyd's algorithm

10. Write a program to implement the knapsack problem

11. Write a program to implement all pair shortest path using Warshall's algorithm

12. Write a program to find the minimum cost spanning tree for the graph using Kruskal's algorithm

13. Write a program to find single source shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm
